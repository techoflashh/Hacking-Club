            An engaging session that covered various aspects of hacking, such as
            network scanning and vulnerability assessment. We provided an overview
            of the fundamentals of hacking and a live challenge to help participants
            understand how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in computer
            systems. The workshop was attended by more than 80 people with
            significant external participation.

            During RnD Showcase 2023, we conducted a workshop on basic
            vulnerabilities and security threats that an individual can face at any time.
            The workshop included a hands-on demonstration where the participants
            gained first-hand experience in identifying security threats. The live
            demonstrations included Keylogger, IPlogger, Rubber duckies, phishing,
            traffic analysis, http vs https and man in the middle. The demonstration
            saw a footfall of approximately 100 people.

            A club staple session that is held every year for the new batch which aims
            to inspire them about the world of cybersecurity and introduce them to the
            basics of ethical hacking. We introduce them to CTF, capture the flag
            events, and conduct a simple one for the freshers to try it out for
            themselves.

        <h2>BreakIn</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- <img src="images/TheBetaChallenge.jpeg" alt="TheBetaChallenge" style="float: left;width: 200px;padding-right: 20px;"> -->
            BreakIn is the Hacking Club’s flagship event which is conducted every
            year. It is a standard 3-day CTF with problems ranging from beginner
            level to advanced. All the problems are original and created by the club
            members themselves. The CTF consisted of approximately 20 problems
            featuring many categories including game hacking, cryptography, web
            forensics, etc. breakIn 2022 saw over 150 registrations including IIIT and
            non-IIIT participants.
